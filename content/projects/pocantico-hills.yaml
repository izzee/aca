description: "Originally a compartmentalized plan, here we have opened into each
  other the Living Room, Dining Room and Breakfast Room creating a unified,
  lofty space that takes full advantage of the ample ceiling height.  All the
  rooms are oriented to fully embrace the picturesque lake-front views filtered
  through the verdant woods. The walnut cabinetry, oak flooring and marble
  counter tops combine to give the space a gentle warmth and human scale. The
  architectural vocabulary is simple and modern, comfortable, and relaxed. It
  functions wonderfully for a family with young children while being easily
  adaptable for the future. "

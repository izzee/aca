description: Working with the office of Jacque Grange we designed a youthful and
  sophisticated home for a young, growing family. The interior architecture
  builds on traditional pre-war details with subtle references to French Art
  Deco; its serenity creating a refined background for Mr. Grangeâ€™s bright
  colors and bold&nbsp;furnishings.

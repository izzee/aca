description: An interior renovation of a modest suburban home, this project is
  noteworthy because of how dramatically we transformed the home on a limited
  budget. In the Stair Hall, a new wall and arched opening define the previously
  rambling space framing the entrance to the Living Room. There, we reshaped and
  lowered the ceiling to make the Living Room more rational and properly
  proportioned. Large windows were added to bathe the previously dark rooms in
  natural light while exposing the beautiful views to the south. The Master
  Bathroom was similarly transformed with modest materials and simple
  re-planning. Elizabeth Schumacher elegantly redecorated the spaces.

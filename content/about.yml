intro:
  - text: Founded in 1999, Arthur Chabon Architects is an award winning,
      full-service architecture, interior design and graphic design firm. With
      projects throughout the world, ACA’s work ranges from academic and
      religious buildings to high-end, luxury residences. These projects include
      new buildings, adaptive re-use of existing buildings and both full and
      partial renovations.
  - text: ACA’s practice is characterized by an intense focus on design and a close
      collaboration with their clients. The architectural language of their
      projects is never imposed or pre-conceived. Rather, it is discovered by
      analysis of the context, the requirements of the program, the nature of
      the materials, and the needs of their clients. With a common understanding
      and shared goals, ACA leads their clients to successful results.
  - text: We are the proud recipients of the American Institute of Architect’s Faith
      and Form award for the Palm Beach Synagogue in Florida and the Institute
      of Classical Architecture and Art’s Newman Award for the Roaring Fork
      Compound in Aspen, Colorado. Our projects have been published in numerous
      print periodicals and on-line publications including Architectural Digest,
      Colorado Homes, Aspen Magazine, the Huffington Post and more.

title: Sunshine Ranch Art Studio
category: residential
location: Aspen, CO.
size: 500 sf
type: New Construction
description: An addition to a house in Aspen, Colorado for which we designed the
  interiors, this art studio is designed to harmonize with the architecture of
  the main house and optimize natural light and scenic views. Close enough to
  the house to be easily accessible, yet seperate enough to feel like a
  "destination", it is a personal refuge from a busy professional and social
  life and an efficient, practical workspace for a dedicated artist.

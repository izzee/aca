description: As additional space for this growing congregation became necessary,
  adjacent buildings were added over the years to the original corner building.
  The goal of this project is to seamlessly integrate the interior spaces of
  three distinct buildings and create a coherent identity for their historical
  facades. The interior architectural language is an eclectic mix of Moorish,
  Eastern European and oriental motifs with the unavoidable and welcome
  inspiration of Addison Mizner. The exterior design unifies the three
  structures while respecting their individuality and thus the scale and texture
  of the streetscape. The new pediment over the center building articulates the
  entrance and gives the composition a figural identity.

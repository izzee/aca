title: A Family Farm
category: residential
location: Deal, NJ
size: 15,000 sf Main Residence
type: Interior Architecture, Exterior Alterations and Additions
description: A project that has spanned decades and continues to evolve, this
  family compound consists of a primary home, guest houses and ancillary
  structures that have been transformed over the years to respond to the
  changing needs of a couple first with young children and eventually including
  an extended family with grandchildren. Originally part of a vast working farm
  with structures dating back to the 18th century, it is now a family compound
  with expansive vegetable and flower gardens, grazing paddocks, a tennis court
  and pool. With the original barns and houses largely intact, the continued use
  of the “farm-house vernacular”, is the perfect architectural vocabulary to
  employ as it allows for additions to the structures in a manner that is
  neither self-conscious nor contrived. Rather, it is the direct response to the
  programmatic and practical needs of the family, the natural environment, and
  the garden views.

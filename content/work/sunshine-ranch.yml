description: Working closely with designer Rose Tarlow, we developed an interior
  architecture that evokes the sensibility of a mountain home while maintaining
  an air of classical serenity and restraint. The informal spaces are
  distinguished by rustic materials like reclaimed French limestone floors,
  timber beams, and antique architectural artifacts. The formal rooms are
  characterized by intricate classical details and significantly more refined
  materials. Throughout, the authenticity of the design is largely achieved by
  the authenticity of these materials. We seamlessly integrated into the
  architecture chimney pieces, antique doors, and limestone surrounds purchased
  by Ms. Tarlow in Europe, scaling the rooms and ornament in harmony with these
  elements.

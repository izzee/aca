type: Addition and Renovation
description: This mid-century home sits on a hill directly facing the majestic
  Hudson River. Our task was to re-conceive the exterior while keeping the
  massing and much of the original materials intact. We were further tasked with
  adding a new wing that includes an in-law’s suite, a nanny’s room, a laundry
  room, and a mud room. We ran this wing perpendicular to the main house
  terminating it with the in-law’s bedroom facing out to the river.  Our
  re-design of the main house unifies the living room and dining room along the
  west wall of the house with a span of patio doors framing expansive Hudson
  River views.  The kitchen and family rooms anchor each end and are partially
  open to the newly combined rooms. This arrangement provides a continuity of
  space with their doors open, or a separation of space with their doors closed,
  thus allowing for a range of simultaneous activities for this
  multi-generational family. The interior architecture is simple and restrained
  giving primacy to the dramatic exterior landscape and views. On the exterior,
  fieldstone, timber casings and warm wood tones blend with the landscape,

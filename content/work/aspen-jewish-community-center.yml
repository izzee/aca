description: The Aspen Jewish Community Center has been heralded as the first
  building ever built in the Roaring Fork Valley fully dedicated to serving the
  Jewish community. The complex combines cultural, community and religious
  facilities. It hosts art shows, music performances, lectures, films and
  more.  At the same time, it provides religious support, classes, and prayer
  services.  The complex consists of the Jewish Center on the west and a
  parsonage on the east.  Adjacent to the parsonage are six landmarked
  motor-lodge cabins which we were required to preserve. Our decidedly
  contemporary and understated design is simultaneously respectful and even
  deferential to its architectural and natural context. Its massing and scale
  relate to the residential buildings around it, while its wire-brushed mahogany
  siding and light stone gables, harmonize with the surrounding colors and
  textures of the landscape. The interior is elegant and minimalist while still
  warm and inviting. The lobby greets visitors with a large fireplace of
  board-formed concrete surrounded by a comfortable seating group. The sanctuary
  is bathed in light and commands dramatic views of the Aspen mountain
  ranges.  My studio designed the liturgical furnishings, memorial boards and
  light fixtures. The parsonage is more than a home for the Rabbi and his
  family; there they will host traditional Friday night dinners and meet
  privately with community members. The modest building is composed of simple
  cubic forms that modulate the scale of the main building on the west as it
  descends to the more diminutive scale of the historical cabins to the east.

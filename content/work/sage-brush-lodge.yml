location: Aspen, CO
size: 14,000 sf Main Residence
type: Interior Architecture
description: The interior of this Aspen, Colorado home is rooted in the work of
  English and American craftsmen architects. It is especially inspired by the
  rustic classicism of Bernard Maybeck. Designed to be comfortable and intimate
  for a family with young children, the interiors also had to be suitable for
  entertaining on a grand scale. The decorating by the late Buck Rodriguez is an
  eclectic mix of folk art, Arts and Crafts and classic Americana and was
  designed to accommodate an extensive and evolving folk art collection. As with
  all our work, historicism serves to bind the house to its context and provide
  a clear and consistent language from which to explore space and form.

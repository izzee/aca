description: In this design for a new home in Dallas, TX, we gave a contemporary
  expression to a traditional Mediterranean home. Inspired by the work of
  Wallace Neff, George Washington Smith and Addison Mizner we sought a sense of
  grandeur tempered by subtle asymmetries and tactile natural materials like
  stucco, sandstone, and reclaimed clay tiles.

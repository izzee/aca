title: Shingle Style in Riverdale
category: residential
location: Riverdale, NY
size: 5000 sf Residence
type: Addition and Renovation
description: This addition to a 1909 house in Riverdale, NY, sits on a sloping
  site with views of the Hudson River to the west. A broad front lawn slopes
  dramatically away from the front while the smaller east-facing rear yard is
  cut into the hill. The original gambrel roof at the living room and dining
  room to the south was restored while a new kitchen, family room and garage
  were added on the north. New dormers were added throughout to improve and
  enlarge the second floor bedrooms. Spaces that had been rather congested and
  dark were opened up. All the first floor rooms were given front and rear
  exposures insuring full penetration of light throughout the year and cool
  Hudson River breezes in the summer months. The goal in the design of this home
  was to create a seamless unified whole where the new entity becomes a complete
  and coherent composition with a life of its own.

type: 13,500 sf Main House, 6,000 sf Guest House and ADU Pedestrian Bridge
description: With nods to the English and Scottish Arts-and-Crafts movement,
  traditional in its basic form and finely detailed, this house sits on the edge
  of the Roaring Fork River facing the majestic peaks of Independence Pass.
  Across the river is the guest house; a bridge connects the two. The floor plan
  is formal and processional. The grand apsidal Entry Hall leads to clearly
  delineated axially arranged entertainment spaces. Throughout, large windows
  frame gorgeous views, bringing inside the serenity of the mountains, the
  sounds of the river and the smells of the forest. The grand yet unpretentious
  furnishings were collected by the owners during their many trips to Europe.
  Cherubs appear unexpectedly, and fine 19th century ormolu consoles are
  contrasted by well-worn upholstered pieces. Unfussy, even whimsical, three
  centuries of design are in comfortable, casual&nbsp;dialogue.

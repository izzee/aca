description: "A remodel of a Fifth Avenue penthouse duplex with spectacular views of Central Park, this apartment was designed to feature an important collection of modern art and to provide a comfortable relaxed atmosphere for an “empty nest” couple. Working with the designer Mica Ertegun, we created a crisp and clear architectural background. We opened up separated spaces and replaced elaborate moldings with simplified ones."

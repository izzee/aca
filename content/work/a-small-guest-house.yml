title: A Small Guest House
category: residential
location: Deal, NJ
size: 2,100 sf
type: New Construction
description: "To accommodate their growing family, our clients requested we
  design a small guest house that evokes the sensibility and modesty of the
  Shingle Style beach cottages and post-war worker houses native to the
  neighborhood.  Our design is simple and understated with materials like the
  thick Alaskan yellow cedar shingles and the pebble dash stucco chimney and
  water table giving the home texture, patina and scale. Generously sized
  windows provide plenty of natural light and views of the expansive landscape.
